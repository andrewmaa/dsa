Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102)

RUNBOOK: 
This program can be compiled by executing the following command while in the simpleProgrammingLanguage directory:
javac *.java

This program can be run by executing the following command while in the simpleProgrammingLanguage directory:
java ExpressionRepl

Example ('>' indicates user input): 
> x = 10
x = 10.0
> y = x + 5
y = 15.0
> y
15.0
> y = x / z
Unbound variable: z
Not solved.


TIME SPENT: 
This project took around 10 hours to complete.

NOTES:
There was some difficulty initially with understanding how to properly implement the get() and put() methods in the MapImplemented class. Another challenge was ensuring that the REPL correctly parsed and evaluated expressions in the solveIfPossible method, especially when dealing with variable assignments and updates.

RESOURCES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: 
Similar to the previous project, the code in this project was submitted through ChatGPT to identify any exceptions
or bugs that would have caused problems, particularly looking at any minor syntax
or formatting errors. Additionally, I consulted my notes from CSCI-UA 101 to 
review some basic syntax.
