Fibonacci Tester

Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102)

RUNBOOK: 
This program can be compiled by executing the command:
javac FibonacciTester.java

This program can be run by executing the command:
java Fibonacci Tester maxInput maxTime
, where:
- maxInput is the maximum input, the larget Fibonacci value to test
- maxTime is the maximum time, the largest amount of time (in milliseconds)
that the program is willing to wait for an algorithm to finish before canceling a higher input.

TIME SPENT: 
This project took around 2 hours to complete.

NOTES:
There was some difficulty initially with setting up the 
dynamic programming approach. Additionally, one "bug" that 
appeared throughout the completion of this project was the overflow
issue that occurred when inputting a high maxInput, as there is a maximum
value for the long data type in Java.

RESOURCES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: 
The code in this project was submitted through ChatGPT to identify any exceptions
or bugs that would have caused problems, particularly looking at any minor syntax
or formatting errors. Additionally, I consulted my notes from CSCI-UA 101 to 
review some basic Java concepts.
