There was some difficulty initially with understanding how to properly implement the

RESOURCES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: 
Similar to the previous project, the code in this project was submitted through ChatGPT to identify any exceptions
or bugs that would have caused problems, particularly looking at any minor syntax
or formatting errors. Additionally, I consulted my notes from CSCI-UA 101 to 
review some basic syntax.
