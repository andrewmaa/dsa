# data structures (dsa)

This repository contains various assignments and class files for Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102). Each assignment focuses on different data structures and algorithms, implemented in Java. Below is a brief overview of the assignments included in this repository:

## Assignments

### 1. [Fibonacci Tester (Assignment 0)](homework/fibonacciTester/)
**Date:** September 20, 2024  
This assignment tests the efficiency of different algorithms for computing Fibonacci numbers, including recursion, dynamic programming, and a closed form. The program allows the user to specify the maximum input value and the maximum time to wait for an algorithm to complete.

### 2. [Elementary Cellular Automata (Assignment 1)](homework/elementaryCellularAutomata/)
**Date:** October 7, 2024  
This assignment simulates an elementary cellular automaton based on a specified rule. The user can define the rule, colors for alive and dead cells, random seed, size of the automaton, initialization density, and the number of iterations to run.
### 3. [Text Based Browser (Assignment 2)](homework/textBasedBrowser/)
**Date:** October 24, 2024  
This assignment simulates a text-based browser with a specified number of frames. Using stacks, the program keeps track of the pages visited, allowing navigation through the pages in each frame using `back` and `forward` commands. The size of the browser can also be specified.

### 3a. [Order of Operations (Assignment 3a)](homework/orderOfOperations/)
**Date:** November 11, 2024  
This assignment involves the use of binary trees to interpret and calculate the result of mathematical expressions. The program parses an input expression, constructs a binary tree where each node represents an operator or operand, and then evaluates the tree to produce the final result. This approach ensures that the order of operations is correctly followed.

### 3b. [Simple Programming Language (Assignment 3b)](homework/simpleProgrammingLanguage/)
**Date:** November 18, 2024  
This assignment creates a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for a simple programming language. The language supports variables, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements. The program uses a stack to evaluate expressions and a hash map to store variable values.

### 4a. [Huffman Code (Assignment 4a)](homework/huffmanCode/)
**Date:** November 26, 2024  
This assignment builds a Huffman tree from a given legend and provides options to print the tree in different formats. It includes methods for encoding and decoding messages using the Huffman tree.

### 4b. [Huffman Converter (Assignment 4b)](homework/huffmanConverter/)
**Date:** December 9, 2024  
This assignment implements a Huffman coding system that can compress text by building a Huffman tree and generating binary codes for characters based on their frequency. The program can be run in different modes to analyze input, encode messages, or decode compressed data.

## Compilation and Execution
Each assignment includes a detailed runbook with instructions on how to compile and run the programs. Ensure you are in the correct directory before executing the commands.

## Time Spent
The time spent on each project varies, with detailed notes provided in each assignment's readme file.

## Resources and Acknowledgements
The code in these projects was reviewed using ChatGPT to identify any exceptions or bugs, particularly focusing on minor syntax or formatting errors. Additionally, notes from CSCI-UA 101 were consulted to review basic programming concepts.

*For more detailed information, refer to the individual readme files in each assignment's directory.*
