# data structures (dsa)

This repository contains various assignments and class files for Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102). Each assignment focuses on different data structures and algorithms, implemented in Java. Below is a brief overview of the assignments included in this repository:

## Assignments

### 1. [Fibonacci Tester (Assignment 0)](homework/fibonacciTester/)
**Date:** September 20, 2024  
This assignment tests the efficiency of different algorithms for computing Fibonacci numbers, including recursion, dynamic programming, and a closed form. The program allows the user to specify the maximum input value and the maximum time to wait for an algorithm to complete.

### 2. [Elementary Cellular Automata (Assignment 1)](homework/elementaryCellularAutomata/)
**Date:** October 7, 2024  
This assignment simulates an elementary cellular automaton based on a specified rule. The user can define the rule, colors for alive and dead cells, random seed, size of the automaton, initialization density, and the number of iterations to run.
### 3. [Text Based Browser (Assignment 2)](homework/textBasedBrowser/)
**Date:** October 24, 2024  
This assignment simulates a text-based browser with a specified number of frames. Using stacks, the program keeps track of the pages visited, allowing navigation through the pages in each frame using `back` and `forward` commands. The size of the browser can also be specified.



## Compilation and Execution
Each assignment includes a detailed runbook with instructions on how to compile and run the programs. Ensure you are in the correct directory before executing the commands.

## Time Spent
The time spent on each project varies, with detailed notes provided in each assignment's readme file.

## Resources and Acknowledgements
The code in these projects was reviewed using ChatGPT to identify any exceptions or bugs, particularly focusing on minor syntax or formatting errors. Additionally, notes from CSCI-UA 101 were consulted to review basic programming concepts.

*For more detailed information, refer to the individual readme files in each assignment's directory.*
